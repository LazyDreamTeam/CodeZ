CodeZ
=====

Project of a snippet manager, with a Qt client and a PHP website.

Based on idleman's idea and inspired by Uri Fridman's [CodeX](http://blog.idleman.fr/?p=1367), the CodeZ client
lets you store, manage, edit and categorize your code snippets.
Snippets are store using JSON files, in a format close to CodeX's.

The PHP website is a project of a syncrhonizing and publishing tool to help centralize and share snippets.

**Note:** this project is currently not maintained as each of us moved to other projects, although someday we might
get back to work on it.
In the meantime, feel free to fork it, work on it and even send some pull request. We might integrate it.
